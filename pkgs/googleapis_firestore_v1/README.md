An experimental gRPC client for the Cloud Firestore API.

## About

Cloud Firestore is a fast, fully managed, serverless, cloud-native NoSQL
document database that simplifies storing, syncing, and querying data for
your mobile, web, and IoT apps at global scale. Its client libraries provide
live synchronization and offline support, while its security features and
integrations with Firebase and Google Cloud Platform accelerate building
truly serverless apps.

This package is a generated gRPC client used to access the Firestore API.

## Status: Experimental

**NOTE**: This package is currently experimental and published under the
[labs.dart.dev](https://dart.dev/dart-team-packages) pub publisher in order to
solicit feedback. 

For packages in the labs.dart.dev publisher we generally plan to either graduate
the package into a supported publisher (dart.dev, tools.dart.dev) after a period
of feedback and iteration, or discontinue the package. These packages have a
much higher expected rate of API and breaking changes.

Your feedback is valuable and will help us evolve this package. For general
feedback, suggestions, and comments, please file an issue in the 
[bug tracker](https://github.com/dart-lang/labs/issues).
